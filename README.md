# SegwayVision
The project utilizes  convolutional-based network architectures for semantic image segmentation. This project utilizes the Indian Driving Dataset (IDD) Lite to classify various elements in Indian road scenes into predefined categories. Our implementation utilizes FCN8, U-Net, PSPNet, LINKNet, and DEEPLABV3+, with DEEPLABV3+ .
